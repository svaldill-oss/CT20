This week I got my first taste of coding myself in p5.js and had a lot of fun and had a good opportunity to learn. 
Sometimes, it is hard for me to follow along but when I am able to work on things myself things became much clearer.
I got to work on a little project and had a lot of fun with it. My favorite part about learning new things is when you
reach a point where you are comfortable enough to play around and try to figure out new things on your own.
I will leave the link to my sketch/code below.
