This week I had lots of fun trying to recreate a wall drawing in the p5js editor. 
At first the wall drawing a selected was just hurting my brain so I pivoted and found
a different drawing to try. While it seemed simpler at first glance I still had a hard time with it.
It was a good challenge however and I was able to use materials from what I learned in the class
tutorial as well as the p5js reference and tutorial page. I learn the best when I do my own hands on work
so this was a really fun and helpful project. I wanted to figure out a way to simulate a texture look
but was yet to figure it out so that is something I want to keep in mind going further into this class. I'll attach
a link to my project, https://editor.p5js.org/svaldill/sketches/6xAxgrWO_
