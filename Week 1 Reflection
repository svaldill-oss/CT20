I was very worried when it came to starting this class because I have very little to zero coding retention.
It has always been my weak point when it came to academics because it stressed me out so much. Luckily, the first time I saw p5.js
i realized it is unlike coding  have done before and seemed simple and even fun. I look forward to learning more.
